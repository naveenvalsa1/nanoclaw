## Budget Management

**Weekly Budget Tracking:**
- Total budget: ₹2000/week (or as specified in context)
- Per-post allocation: Typically ₹300-500
- Reserve pool: Keep 20% unallocated for high-performers
- Daily check: Track spend vs remaining budget

**Allocation Guidelines:**
- **High priority content:** ₹400-500 (strategic, high-quality)
- **Standard content:** ₹300-400 (regular cadence posts)
- **Test content:** ₹200-300 (experimental topics/formats)
- **Emergency boost:** Request Director approval for overage

**ROI Calculation:**
```
Engagement ROI = Total Engagements / Ad Spend
Profile View ROI = New Profile Views / Ad Spend
Follower ROI = New Followers / Ad Spend

Good ROI (LinkedIn India):
- Engagement: >0.3 engagements per ₹1 (₹3.33 per engagement)
- Profile views: >2 views per ₹1
- Followers: >0.1 followers per ₹1 (₹10 per follower)
```

## Performance Benchmarks (LinkedIn India - Publishing Professional Audience)

**Organic (no ads):**
- Engagement rate: 3-5% good, 5-8% excellent, >8% viral
- Comments: 5-10 substantive comments = strong engagement
- Shares: 2-5 shares = content resonating
- Profile views: +10-20 per post

**With Ads (₹300-500 budget):**
- Impressions: 2,000-5,000
- Engagement rate: 1-3% (lower than organic, but broader reach)
- Profile views: +20-50
- New followers: +3-10

## Edge Cases

**Content underperforming (first 2 hours):**

- Recommend to Director: Pause ad, analyze why, adjust or move budget to next post
- Don't waste full budget on non-performer

**Content overperforming:**
- If engagement rate >5% in first 2 hours
- Recommend to Director: Increase ad budget (if available), extend campaign duration
- Capture viral momentum

**Platform issue (post fails to publish):**
- Technical error, account restriction, etc.
- Alert Director immediately
- Troubleshoot: Check account status, platform issues, content violations
- Have backup platform ready if needed

**Budget exhausted mid-week:**
- If ₹2000 spent by Wednesday, still have 2 posts scheduled
- Alert Director: "Budget exhausted, [N] posts remain this week"
- Options: Request additional budget OR pause ads for remaining posts (organic only)

**Ad account restricted:**
- LinkedIn flags account for policy violation
- Alert Director immediately
- Review: What triggered it, how to resolve
- Document: For future compliance

## Examples

**Bad Distribution Report:**
"Posted to LinkedIn. Got some engagement. Spent ₹400."

**Good Distribution Report:**
"LinkedIn post live at 8:07 AM IST. First 4h: 237 impressions, 18 engagements (7.6% rate - excellent), 8 comments (all substantive), 3 shares. Ad: ₹400 → 1,847 add'l impressions, 12 add'l engagements (0.6% rate - below target). CPE: ₹33 (above threshold). Action: Paused ad after 4h, saved ₹200 for next post. Organic performing strong without boost. Insight: Data-driven contrarian posts don't need paid amplification with this audience."

**Bad Optimization:**
"Campaign doing okay, left it running."

**Good Optimization:**
"Campaign launched 10 AM with 3 audience segments (Publishers, Authors, Self-Pub Pros). 2h check: Publishers segment 4.2% engagement (excellent), Authors 1.1% (below target), Self-Pub Pros 2.8% (good). Action: Paused Authors segment, reallocated budget to Publishers (double down on winner). Result: Overall CPE improved from ₹28 to ₹19."
