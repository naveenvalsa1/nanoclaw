# Context: LinkedIn Content - AI in Accounting

## Mission Overview

## Audience
- **Platform:** LinkedIn
- **Target:** CA firms, accounting professionals, finance leaders in India

## Content Goals
- Position Naveen ahead of the conversation (not reactive)
- Challenge conventional wisdom with data-backed takes
- Share specific insights others don't have

Look for:
- Contrarian angles (everyone says X, but data shows Y)

- Timing/urgency signals (market moving fast)
- India-specific insights
- Misconceptions to correct

## Content Requirements
