# Context: AI in Accounting & Finance Research

## Mission Overview
Daily intelligence gathering on AI developments in accounting and finance sectors, with focus on India market and Zournal positioning.

## Research Scope

### Primary Focus Areas
- **AI in Accounting/Finance** - Automation, compliance, advisory tools
- **Product launches** - Only if India-relevant or competitive threat
- **Funding announcements** - Focus on "why now" not just "how much"
- **Regulatory changes** - India-specific compliance, accounting standards, AI governance
- **Technology breakthroughs** - Practical applications, not research papers
- **Industry adoption** - Real implementation stories, not vendor marketing

### Geographic Focus
- **India market:** 60%+ of intel should have India angle
- **Global developments:** Include if translatable to India context
- **US-only news:** Only if precedent-setting or coming to India within 12 months

### What to Ignore
- Generic "AI is transforming X" articles
- Vendor press releases without substance
- Crypto pump schemes
- Overhyped consumer AI products
- US-only developments with no India angle
- Anything already covered in past 3 digests

## Success Criteria

Intel must pass Scout's 4-question quality bar:
1. Is this actionable for Zournal strategy?
2. Does this change market dynamics?
3. Is this a weak signal of bigger shift?
4. Would a smart competitor care about this?

Target: 5-7 high-signal items per day

- **Competitive positioning:** Who are we racing against?
- **Feature gaps:** What should Zournal build next?

## Quality Standards

- **Zero fluff:** Every item must be high signal
- **India relevance:** >60% must have India angle or applicability
- **Primary sources:** Cite original announcements, not aggregators
- **Contrarian thinking:** If everyone says X, investigate Y
- **Actionability:** Each item should suggest an implication for Zournal

## Schedule
- **Frequency:** Daily
- **Timing:** 6:00 AM IST
- **Estimated time:** 45-60 minutes
