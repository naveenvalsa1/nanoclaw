# Context: Personal Brand - Entrepreneurship & Venture Building

## Mission Overview
Build Naveen Valsakumar's personal brand as a thought leader in Entrepreneurship and Venture Building, with occasional posts linking to his businesses (Notion Press, Zournal, Zero Origin) as real-world examples.

## Mission Goals
- **Thought leadership:** Establish Naveen as go-to voice on entrepreneurship, building businesses, venture building
- **Community building:** Build engaged audience of entrepreneurs, founders, aspiring business builders
- **Indirect business development:** Attract Z0 partners, potential co-founders, quality connections (not direct selling)
- **Visibility:** Increase profile views, follower count, inbound opportunities from founder/builder community

## Audience

### Primary Target
- **Entrepreneurs & Founders:** Startup founders, indie hackers, solopreneurs, business builders (India + global)
- **Aspiring entrepreneurs:** People wanting to start businesses, looking for insights on how to begin
- **Venture builders:** People interested in Zero Origin model (partnering with domain experts)
- **Domain experts considering entrepreneurship:** CAs, publishers, industry professionals thinking of building businesses

### Demographics
- Location: India (primary), US/UK/global (secondary)
- LinkedIn activity: Active professionals, decision-makers
- Industry: Publishing, media, writing, tech, entrepreneurship
- Seniority: Mix of individual contributors and senior leaders

### Psychographics
- Curious about AI but skeptical of hype
- Value data over opinions
- Appreciate contrarian takes
- Respect direct communication
- Want practical insights, not theory

## Naveen's Voice & Tone

### Core Voice Attributes
- **Direct:** No fluff, get to the point
- **Data-driven:** Back claims with numbers, examples, sources
- **Contrarian:** Challenge conventional wisdom when warranted
- **Authentic:** Personal experience, not generic advice
- **No BS:** Call out hype, admit unknowns, be honest

### Communication Style
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Active voice always
- Concrete examples over abstractions ("Pratilipi raised $20M" not "Some companies are well-funded")
- Questions to engage thinking ("What does this mean for indie authors?")
- Strategic implications explicit ("This validates X" or "This threatens Y")

### Banned Phrases (Never Use)
- "Excited to announce"
- "Thrilled to share"
- "Thoughts?"
- "This!"
- "Agree?"
- "Let that sink in"
- "Unpopular opinion"
- "Game-changer"
- "Disruptive"
- "AI will replace writers" (challenge this narrative instead)
- Generic listicles ("10 tips to..." without specificity)

### Voice Examples

**Bad (Too Generic):**
"Entrepreneurship is hard but rewarding. What are your thoughts?"

**Good (Naveen's Voice):**
"Most founders think product-market fit is a destination. It's not. Notion Press had PMF in 2014. Lost it in 2017 when Amazon changed algorithms. Found it again in 2019. PMF is a moving target. Build for the chase, not the arrival."

**Bad (Too Hype):**
"Excited to share my game-changing insights on building startups!"

**Good (Naveen's Voice):**
"Zero Origin's thesis: Domain experts make better founders than MBAs. We partner 50-50 with CAs, publishers, industry insiders. They know the problem. We build the solution. Three years in: 70% success rate vs 10% industry average. Credentials don't build companies. Problem obsession does."

3. **Z0 visibility & partner attraction:** Showcase venture building model, attract potential domain expert co-founders

4. **Use businesses as proof points:** Reference Notion Press, Zournal, Z0 portfolio as EXAMPLES of principles (not promotion)

5. **India market focus:** Emphasize India-specific entrepreneurship context (market opportunities, challenges, what works here)

## Constraints & Guidelines

### Topics to Avoid

- **Competitor bashing:** Don't attack other companies/founders
- **Political commentary:** Keep focus on business/entrepreneurship
- **Personal life:** Keep professional focus (occasional behind-scenes OK, but not family/personal)
- **Unverified claims:** No speculation without data
- **Startup clichés:** No "hustle porn," "fail fast," generic startup advice

### Business Examples Guidelines
- **Use businesses as CASE STUDIES, not promotions**
- "At Notion Press, we learned X" (lesson) vs "Notion Press is the best platform" (promotion)
- Reference specific numbers, decisions, pivots from real experience
- Share both wins AND failures
- Connect specific business examples to universal entrepreneurship principles

### Ethical Guidelines
- Disclose AI use in content creation if used (per India IT Rules)
- Credit sources properly
- Don't claim credit for others' insights
- Be honest about unknowns and limitations
