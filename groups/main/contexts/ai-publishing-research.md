# Context: AI in Publishing & Self-Publishing Research

## Mission Overview
Daily intelligence gathering on AI developments in publishing, self-publishing, print-on-demand, and author tools sectors, with focus on India market and Notion Press positioning.

## Research Scope

### Primary Focus Areas
- **AI content creation tools** - Writing assistants, editing tools, book generation
- **Self-publishing platforms** - New entrants, feature updates, pricing changes
- **Print-on-demand** - Technology improvements, cost reductions, distribution
- **Book marketing AI** - Cover design, blurb generation, audience targeting
- **Author tools** - Research, outlining, formatting, collaboration
- **Publishing industry trends** - Traditional vs self-pub dynamics, market shifts
- **Regulatory/Copyright** - AI content ownership, disclosure requirements

### Geographic Focus
- **India market:** 60%+ of intel should have India angle
- **Global developments:** Include if applicable to Indian authors/market
- **US/EU news:** Only if precedent-setting or coming to India

### What to Ignore
- Generic AI writing tool launches (unless publishing-specific)
- Academic publishing news (different market)
- Traditional big publisher drama (unless impacts self-pub)
- Consumer reading apps (unless author-relevant)
- Non-English language tools (unless multilingual capability)

## Success Criteria

Intel must pass Scout's 4-question quality bar:
1. Is this actionable for Notion Press strategy?
2. Does this change market dynamics?
3. Is this a weak signal of bigger shift?
4. Would a smart competitor care about this?

Target: 5-7 high-signal items per day

## Strategic Lens

### Notion Press Context
- **Business:** India's largest self-publishing platform
- **Model:** Full-service (editing, design, distribution, marketing)
- **Target:** Indian authors wanting to self-publish
- **Key question:** How does AI change author expectations and competitive dynamics?

### Key Strategic Themes
- **Author enablement:** What can authors now do themselves with AI?
- **Quality bar:** Does AI raise or lower published book quality?
- **Competitive threats:** Who's building AI-first publishing platforms?
- **Service gaps:** What should Notion Press add/automate/improve?
- **Pricing pressure:** Do AI tools commoditize editing/design services?
- **Market expansion:** Can AI unlock new author segments?

## Quality Standards

- **Zero fluff:** Every item must be high signal
- **India relevance:** >60% must have India angle or applicability
- **Primary sources:** Cite original announcements, not aggregators
- **Author perspective:** How does this change author experience/expectations?
- **Actionability:** Each item should suggest an implication for Notion Press

## Banned Terms/Angles
- Don't cover: AI replacing authors (tired narrative)
- Don't cover: "ChatGPT can write your book" clickbait
- Focus instead: AI as tool for authors, not replacement

## Schedule
- **Frequency:** Daily
- **Timing:** 6:10 AM IST (10 min after accounting research)
- **Estimated time:** 45-60 minutes

## Next Steps After Research
Scout's output feeds into:
1. Publisher (creates daily newsletter for publishing industry)
2. Potential content for Notion Press blog/social
