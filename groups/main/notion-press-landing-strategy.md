## Design Elements to Reduce Complexity Perception

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Clean White Space:** Don't crowd the page. Each section has breathing room.
2. **Simple Navigation:** Minimal menu (Logo | Services | About | Contact). Focus = CTA.
3. **Professional Typography:**
   - Headings: Clean serif (Playfair Display or similar) - authority
   - Body: Sans-serif (Inter, Open Sans) - easy reading
   - Large, readable font sizes (18px+ for body)

### Color Psychology
- **Primary:** Deep blue (#1a365d) - trust, professionalism
- **Accent:** Gold/amber (#f59e0b) - premium, authority
- **CTA:** High contrast (orange or bright blue) - stands out
- **Background:** White/light gray - clean, uncluttered

### Process Visualization
- **Linear Flow:** Clear 1 → 2 → 3 progression
- **Large Numbers:** Step numbers should be prominent (80px+)
- **Icons:** Simple, professional icons (not playful/cartoonish)
- **Progress Indicators:** Visual lines connecting steps

### Trust Signals Throughout
- **Author Photos:** Professional headshots in testimonials
- **Book Covers:** Real books published, professionally designed
- **Media Logos:** Small, tasteful placement (footer or trust badge row)
- **Certification/Numbers:** Subtle but visible

### Mobile Optimization
- **Touch-Friendly CTAs:** Large buttons (min 48px height)
- **Vertical Stack:** 3-step process stacks vertically on mobile
- **Thumb-Zone CTA:** Fixed bottom CTA bar on mobile
- **Fast Load:** Optimize images, lazy load below fold
