# Content Strategy Update - Feb 16, 2026

## Changes Made

### Primary Focus SHIFTED
**From:** Publishing + AI + Entrepreneurship (Publishing 60%, Entrepreneurship 30%)
**To:** Entrepreneurship + Venture Building (Entrepreneurship 70%, Business Examples 20%)

### New Audience
**Primary:** Entrepreneurs, founders, aspiring business builders, domain experts considering startups
**No longer primary:** Publishing professionals, authors (can still be mentioned as examples)

### New Content Themes (70% Primary)
1. **Entrepreneurship & Building Businesses**
   - How to start/scale businesses
   - Founder lessons from Notion Press/Zournal/Z0
   - What works vs startup mythology
   - India market opportunities
   - Build vs buy, unit economics, pivots

2. **Venture Building & Z0 Model**
   - Partnering with domain experts
   - Finding co-founders
   - Equity structures
   - Studio model vs traditional startup
   - Portfolio approach

3. **Market Insights**
   - India market gaps
   - Contrarian takes
   - Market timing and validation

### Business References (20% Secondary)
- Use Notion Press, Zournal, Z0 as EXAMPLES, not promotions
- Share real numbers, decisions, pivots
- Both wins AND failures
- Connect to universal principles

### Strategic Priorities Updated
1. Establish entrepreneurship authority (not publishing authority)
2. Build founder/entrepreneur community
3. Z0 visibility & partner attraction
4. Use businesses as proof points (not ads)
5. India market focus

### Voice & Banned Phrases
- Added: No "startup clichés", no "hustle porn", no "fail fast"
- Examples updated to entrepreneurship focus

### Research Sources
- Scout should now focus on: Entrepreneurship news, startup trends, India opportunities
- Can still reference publishing/accounting when relevant to broader entrepreneurship lessons

## What This Means

**Curator:** Look for entrepreneurship trends, startup insights, India market opportunities
**Director:** Brief Scribe on entrepreneurship content, use businesses as case studies
**Scribe:** Write about building businesses, founder lessons, venture building model
**Content angle:** "Here's what I learned building X" not "Here's why X is great"

## Examples of New Content Direction

**Old focus:**
"India's AI content rules go live in 6 days. Here's why this is great news for serious authors."

**New focus:**
"Zero Origin's thesis: Domain experts make better founders than MBAs. We partner 50-50 with CAs, publishers, industry insiders. They know the problem. We build the solution. Three years in: 70% success rate vs 10% industry average."

OR

"Most founders think product-market fit is a destination. It's not. Notion Press had PMF in 2014. Lost it in 2017 when Amazon changed algorithms. Found it again in 2019. PMF is a moving target."

## File Updated
`/workspace/group/contexts/personal-brand-publishing-ai.md` (still same filename, but content now entrepreneurship-focused)
